# Peer Review of HW8 (gb1877)

# Comments: 
- Gaurav made two plots for HW8. 
- In the first plot he presented correlation between the energy used by people and the Greenhouse Gas emission
- In the second plot, he presented a map showing the different levels of GHG emissions across the City at the zipcode level

## CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?
- The first plot is easy to read, with clear title and labels, both of adequate size. 
- The second plot clearly presents the different levels of GHG emissions across the City, but splitting the distribution into more bins may be better at accentuating the difference

ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?
- The first plot is uses orange and blue, a good color choice 
- The second plot 

HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
