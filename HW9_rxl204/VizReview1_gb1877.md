- Gaurav made two plots for HW8.

- In the first plot he presented correlation between the energy used by people and the Greenhouse Gas emission
- In the second plot, he presented a map showing the different levels of GHG emissions across the City at the zipcode level

## CLARITY:
- The first plot is easy to read, with clear title and labels, both of adequate size. 
- The second plot clearly presents the different levels of GHG emissions across the City, but splitting the distribution into more bins may be better at accentuating the difference

## ESTHETIC:
- The first plot is uses orange and blue, a good color choice allowing the graphical elements to stand out
- The second plot uses yellow, greens and blues. While it shows the quantities being visualized, the difference in the colors can be made more distinct to allow the viewer to more accurately understand the difference between zip codes. In addition it is not immediately obvious where on the scale each color belongs to. It may also be better to visualize the boundaries of the zipcode in black. 

## HONESTY:
- The first plot uses log normalized data on both axis, this helps to visualize and understand the data better 
- The second plot shows GHG metric tons in the title, but I think it is reflecting the log normalized GHG metric tons.
