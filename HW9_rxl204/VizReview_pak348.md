## CLARITY:
The plot is clear and easy to read. The y-axis presents the amount of water consumed per person per day in NYC (in Gallons), 
and the x-axis shows the years 1979-2016. The title may be improved to reflect this information, for instance "NYC Water Consumption Per Person Per Day" could be a possible title, and the y-axis can be relabelled as "Volume of Water (Gallons)" or "Gallons of Water"


## ESTHETIC: 
The choice of a bar plot enhances the clarity of the plot, allowing the viewer to immediately understand what is presented. 
While it is possible to present the scale on the y-axis starting from 100, to emphasis on the difference in consumption between years, 
showing it on a scale from 0 places the focus on the actual volume of water consume, while also presenting the trends across the years. 

## HONESTY:
The plot accurately shows water consumption per person per day. 
But it may be helpful to explain why there is such a significant decline in water consumption between 1979 and 2016, perhaps industrial change
