FBB: OK on finding variable etc but I cannot find anywhere the mutiple regression in the second paper you mentioned . They used ANOVA and Bayesian t-test: To test the strength of this mimicry effect, we then conducted a Bayesian t-test in which we tested the hypothesis that the mimicry score (M =1.24; SD = 5.09) was larger than 0 to assess the presence of mimicry and correlation tests (Pearson's) to assess correlation with automatic imitation : "To test the relationship between mimicry and automatic imitation, we ran correlational analyses and will report both the corresponding p-values and BFs. In order to test the relationship between mimicry and automatic imitation, we correlated the mimicry score with all the scores of the automatic imitation task [...] We then computed the BFs of all correlations to investigate whether the null hypothesis (i.e., mimicry and automatic imitation are not positively correlated)"


Assignment 3: 
- Discussed statistical tests, and tables with gaurav

Assignment 4: 
- used Dr Bianco's skeleton notebook
- for part 2, received help from Ian to derive boundaries using boundingbox
- received help from Jack to define function to sort coordinates into respective Manhattan/Brooklyn boundaries
